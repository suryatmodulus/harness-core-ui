          additionalInfo: 'Further, AutoStopping also has a second (optional) level of optimization with orchestrated spot instances. A spot instance is an unused cloud excess capacity that is available for up to 90% cheaper rates than the On-Demand resources. This can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Typically, the limitation of spot instances is the lack of availability guarantees from the cloud provider as they may be taken away with just a 2-minute notice. However, AutoStopping has full spot orchestration built-in. Whenever there is a spot interruption, AutoStopping will automatically provision a new spot instance in its place. If there is no spot capacity available, it will fall back to on-demand to maintain availability. It will also continue to poll the spot market and perform a reverse fall-back from on-demand back to spot whenever spot capacity is available again. This is continuous cost optimization that enables you to leverage spot pricing seamlessly at every opportunity in a fully automated experience.'
